    Dear Deviji 🌸<br><br>

    Some people quietly change the world around them,  
    not by trying — but simply by being themselves 🌷<br><br>

    Your presence feels gentle, calm, and warm,  
    like a garden that makes everything around it softer 🤍<br><br>

    Life doesn’t always move the way we expect.  
    There are pauses, moments of silence, and unexpected turns —  
    yet some bonds feel comforting no matter how time flows 🌼<br><br>

    I am truly grateful for your presence,  
    for your kindness, your simplicity,  
    and for the happiness your existence brings 🌸<br><br>

    On your special day,  
    I wish you days that bloom effortlessly,  
    smiles that come naturally,  
    and a heart that always feels peaceful 🌷✨<br><br>

    May you always be surrounded by flowers you love,  
    warmth that feels safe,  
    and moments that remind you  
    how special you truly are 🤍<br><br>

    Happy Birthday,  
    YASASWINI — Deviji 🌼
